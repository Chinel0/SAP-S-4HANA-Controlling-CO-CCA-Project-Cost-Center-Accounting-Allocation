SAP S/4HANA Controlling (CO-CCA) Project â€“ Cost Center Accounting & Allocation

This project simulates the Cost Center Accounting (CO-CCA) process in SAP S/4HANA, using Global Bike Inc. as the business scenario. 
The project covers:
* Cost center creation
* Expense and key figure planning
* Cost allocation via assessment cycles
* Activity type planning and pricing
* Analysis of plan costs and allocations using reports

Project Overview

Business Scenario
Global Bike Inc. needs to allocate shared and indirect costs (e.g., cafeteria, electricity) to operational cost centers such as Assembly and Maintenance,
ensuring accurate product costing and cost transparency.

This project simulates both the guided case study (cafeteria allocation using employee-based ratio) and the challenge task
(electricity allocation using space ratio of 4:1 between Assembly and Maintenance cost centers).

Tools & Technologies Used

* SAP S/4HANA 2022
* SAP Fiori Launchpad 3.0
* Controlling (CO-CCA) module

Apps Used

* Manage Cost Centers
* Manage G/L Account Master Data
* Manage Statistical Key Figures
* Plan Primary Cost Inputs
* Change Statistical Key Figure Planning
* Create Actual Assessment Cycle
* Execute Actual Assessment Cycle
* Display Actual Cost Center Line Items
* Display Reports for Cost Centers

Process Steps & Activities

Guided Case Study

1. Created cost centers: Assembly (ASSY1005), Maintenance (MAIN1005), Cafeteria (CAFE1005).
2. Created secondary cost elements and activity types (e.g., assembly hours).
3. Created statistical key figures (Number of Employees).
4. Planned primary costs and outputs for cost centers.
5. Created an assessment cycle (CAFEC005) to allocate cafeteria costs based on employee count.
6. Executed price calculation and verified cost center reports.

Challenge Task

1. Created auxiliary cost center (ENER1005) for electricity collection.
2. Planned \$45,000 electricity cost using primary cost element 6325000.
3. Created statistical key figure (ELEC005) for space ratio allocation.
4. Planned 80/20 split (Assembly: 2400 sqm, Maintenance: 600 sqm).
5. Created and executed assessment cycle (ELECT005) using key figure ELEC005.
6. Analyzed the allocation results and validated the correct distribution in actual cost reports.

Business Insights & Value Delivered

* Allocated indirect costs using statistical drivers (employees, space area), improving cost traceability and transparency.
* Enabled more accurate product costing by ensuring true allocation of overheads.
* Leveraged assessment cycles in SAP CO-CCA to automate indirect cost distribution.
* Enhanced understanding of how cost center accounting supports managerial decision-making and controlling processes.

Key Learnings & Skills Demonstrated

* Configured and managed cost centers and secondary cost elements in SAP S/4HANA CO-CCA.
* Planned primary costs, activity outputs, and statistical key figures.
* Created and executed assessment cycles using both fixed ratios and key figures as tracing factors.
* Used standard SAP reports to analyze cost center postings, allocations, and variances.
* Understood integration between Controlling (CO) and Financial Accounting (FI).
